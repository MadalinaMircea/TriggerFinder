a special shoutout below,0
no one likes to see someone vomit,1
if you vomit you will not be scared anymore,1
it was mostly from stomach bugs when i was a kid,1
i think i have not puked since i was  or,1
i used to catch stomach bugs very often,1
vomit free since,1
there was a stomach bug going about,1
and the fact that kids end up getting sick all the time,1
how did you deal with him being sick,1
i did not deal too well with stomach bugs,1
i would rather deal with morning sickness though,1
wondering when he will wake up sick in the night or if his classmates are sick,1
public school has not been an issue with sickness,1
he is a little older and vomiting is not a main concern,1
but i still did not get sick at all,1
i have a  year old boy and i am pregnant with another boy,1
but his dad is not bothered by sickness,1
ill  times a day or more,1
i have  kids and freak out if someone is sick,1
my daughter gets tonsillitis a lot and vomits with it but you get used to it,1
i was never sick never even had morning sickness,1
i am dreading her first stomach bug,1
i am confident that with proper hygiene i will not get the bug from her,1
yes it is terrible when my kids get sick but i have always made it through,1
i had severe morning sickness with my youngest but i never threw up from it,1
i was scared my whole pregnancy that i would have morning sickness,1
even if i had experienced lots of sickness he would be worth it,1
i am terrified of pregnancy because if i vomit i will relapse,1
i was terrified because i just knew i would be ill,1
i got lucky though because i did not get sick my whole pregnancy,1
i was sick with all pregnancies,1
i would love a child but do not think i could cope with the nausea,1
i am afraid i will puke,1
i have a virus and i have been vomiting everyday and its been rough,1
severe vomiting and fever,1
i can not eat much without throwing it back up,1
it will stop the vomiting,1
i am so hungry though due to vomiting,1
right now as we speak i feel like i will puke again,1
panic is crap but at least you did not vomit,1
had a massive panic attack the other because i thought i was going to puke,1
i have been having a lot of health anxiety,1
it reminds me to focus on my goals instead of dwelling on my health anxiety,1
one night when i was feeling super sick and felt like nothing was going right,1
sos smoked so much weed and now i feel super ill,1
the burps coming up my esophagus and it makes me ill,1
i heard it makes you very nauseous,1
i am getting chills feeling run down nauseous etc,1
my stomach is growling like mad,1
just that horrible nausea feeling all day,1
nothing makes me panic quite like morning nausea,1
it is progressed to watery diarrhea and severe vertigo,1
can being dehydrated cause nausea,1
after a night of feeling bad i get home and now cuddling a bucket,1
so far i have collapsed had my head in a bucket twice,1
why are you so sick all the time,1
were you sick,1
did you vomit,1
are you still puking,1
i am not throwing up now just a bit queasy,1
had stomach cramps and now have diarrhea and i feel nauseous,1
i am so worried i have got a bug,1
it is the anxiety most probably causing the sick feeling,1
overcome this anxiety and sick feeling,1
i woke up feeling nauseous,1
no acidic nausea in my throat but my stomach still feels icky,1
anyone get really dizzy and nauseous often,1
my chronic nausea is from anxiety regarding this phobia,1
hunger always makes my nausea worse,1
i have had food poisoning several times,1
the food you ate with your family making you ill,1
anxiety is the number one cause of any and all of my nausea,1
my nausea is an actual illness,1
i started feeling bad earlier,1
i did not know if it was indigestion from eating,1
feeling so sick to my stomach,1
i am so anxious because my stomach has been hurting all day and gurgling,1
and i am super nauseous right now,1
i am scared it is a bug,1
my stomach keeps gurgling and i feel nauseous like my throat is tight,1
it sounds like you might have some reflux,1
i have a slight headache intense nausea and i feel like i am about to gag,1
i am not feeling good i think it is gonna happen,1
every morning i feel nauseous and last week it happened,1
i am scared thinking it will happen again because i am really nauseous again,1
most of the times i start to feel nauseous after breakfast,1
my stomach is all quesy and i am so scared it is a bug,1
they have not been sick,1
i do not think it is that making me feel sick,1
i had a stomach bug back in december and i am scared i will catch another one,1
to catch one you have to ingest the virus particles,1
there are many different strains of stomach bugs,1
i got terrible nausea and dizziness,1
i am absolutely terrified and am afraid i will puke,1
is used to prevent vomiting,1
i thought every morning i would wake up sick,1
i always get nausea and either diarrhea,1
anyone get nauseous after eating like throat gets the throw up sensation,1
gives me horrible acid reflux,1
acting like they were gagging themselves,1
how long has it been since you threw up last,1
the experience of throwing up in front of people,1
i am not so much afraid of myself throwing up only other people,1
and throw up right at the finish line,1
for me to sit there with somebody throwing up i would have to be forced,1
the fear and anxiety i get from somebody even coughing super hard or gagging,1
how much money it would take for you to willingly throw up once,1
i am just terrified that i might throw up in front of people,1
i wanna start understanding throwing up is normal,1
i have not thrown up since i was really suffering with my phobia,1
i am not so much afraid to be sick myself but afraid of others getting sick,1
i can not handle being in the same home with anyone who is getting sick,1
my husband leaves the house if he feels sick,1
someone outside of the people in my home be sick,1
i feel really bad right now,1
i had diarrhea twice my stomach is making noises,1
how many times have you thrown up and why,1
threw up on  different occasions,1
were stomach bugs,1
and one was travel sickness,1
used to throw up as a kid like everyone else,1
only thrown up  times all from alcohol,1
you have never had a stomach bug,1
i refused to puke,1
i have had a few stomach bugs where i did not vomit,1
i am too scared to get drunk in case i vomit,1
have a terrible hangover that makes me sick,1
getting drunk was standard,1
takes about a whole bottle to make me throw up,1
throwing up feels so normal and natural,1
i have witnessed my girlfriend throw up in front of me,1
i was really sick for ages,1
i was just throwing up i ended up in hospital,1
never had stomach bug,1
throw up when i am on my period,1
i have thrown up many times from alcohol,1
it is other people being sick that i am scared of,1
i kinda need to be able to cope with others being sick,1
people throw up all the time,1
i am fine with animals but can not even do baby spit up,1
if anyone even said they were feeling sick near me,1
my sister was in the er once and throwing up,1
boys who are throwing up from a bleed,1
if only i can do the same for myself vomiting,1
when she said she felt sick and gave her a bowl,1
i could not even cope with spit up,1
exposure did not work for myself getting sick,1
if my boyfriend is throwing up i can deal,1
i can not cope with my boyfriend throwing up,1
because of them always getting sick,1
i can be around anyone throwing up,1
i can not watch people throwing up,1
the actual vomit itself makes me feel funny,1
if my friends are sick when i am drunk,1
it does make me gag if i see it,1
i threw up about  or  times from being sick,1
i had not been sick at all until i caught a bug again and threw up,1
the last  times i had the stomach bug i did not throw up,1
used to throw up after every feed as a baby,1
i will still throw up after meals i have only puked twice,1
i only threw up twice when i was a kid,1
never a stomach bug,1
i do not know if i have ever had a stomach bug,1
i have felt sick before but i do anything to avoid vomiting,1
i have not thrown up since i was,1
i threw up only due to having a bad gastritis episode,1
managed to not throw up again,1
and food poisoning,1
what was the food poisoning from,1
have not gotten sick since then,1
i am  and have never thrown up,1
i projectile vomited once as a baby,1
gastritis is the worst because all i do is dry heave,1
all i do is dry heave and it is the worst,1
adults do not vomit often,1
the most common reason for adults to vomit is alcohol,1
i got sick but am unsure if it was a bug or food,1
i have only gotten sick  times,1
i was only sick two times with vomiting,1
i had the bug with just diarrhea like  times,1
i think i have thrown up like  times in my life,1
have vomited i think  times total,1
i have only vomited twice,1
i am equally terrified of nausea as well,1
i have throw up a lot from drinking and pregnancy,1
not caring about throwing up while drunk,1
ate being nauseous when i am hung over,1
i was nauseous during my pregnancies and chemo,1
threw up  times and dry heaved  times,1
separate from the vomiting episodes,1
twice because of a stomach bug,1
once because of food poisoning,1
i threw up as a toddler,1
i did not throw up from an actual illness,1
that technically was not vomiting because it never got out of my mouth,1
i threw up like  times,1
twice from food poisoning when i was a child,1
i have not actually thrown up from a sickness,1
and car sickness once,1
i once got sick when i was  from greasy food,1

amount of bugs or travel sickness episodes,1
mostly from bugs occasional travel sickness,1
the amount of times i had a sickness that made me throw up,1
when i had my stomach bug i threw up at least  times,1
at  i threw up after giving birth to my son,1

when i am feeling unwell i usually just dry heave,1
too many bugs to count food poisoning norovirus,1
only did not vomit out of pure will,1
when i was sick i would only vomit once or twice,1
the other time i only vomited once,1
food poisoning from a gas station chili cheese,1
while  months pregnant that was mostly just dry heaving,1
some nausea with all of my pregnancies but not terrible,1
you forced your body to have diarrhea and not throw up,1
i got car sick a lot as a kid,1
had food poisoning and stomach bugs a lot as a kid,1
only threw up a handful of times,1
i vomited a few times whole in hospital,1
i vomited about  times and was not sure if it was a bug,1
then i threw up when i was  with food poisoning,1
i think one may have been from car sickness,1
i threw up so much for every reason,1
from smelling something gross to motion sickness food poisoning the flu,1
i have almost thrown up several times,1
it stops the nausea,1
salmonella at age,1
please do not throw up,1
i wanna vomit all over,1
is throwing up in his grave,1
he is complaining of bad stomach cramps,1
he is been vomiting and having diarrhea all night,1
just gone to toilet again to vomit,1
does it sound like food poisoning or a stomach bug,1
it sounds like food poisoning,1
you can not catch food poisoning,1
i know it is more than likely food poisoning,1
he is saying his stomach is so sore,1
i am sure he just has food poisoning,1
some bacteria that causes food poisoning is not contagious,1
you can catch food poisoning of certain kinds,1
definitely food poisoning,1
food poisoning is horrible is not it,1
i do not think food poisoning can hit in a half hour,1
food poisoning does not usually set in the fast,1
might not be food poisoning since it is so sudden,1
within  minutes she was really ill,1
i had bad food poisoning after a dodgy sausage roll,1
if it is food poisoning it has most likely,1
and some food poisoning is contagious,1
my mother got food poisoning,1
it definitely could be food poisoning,1
a friend of mine also had food poisoning,1
but i personally have not thrown up,1
alcoholmorning sickness,1
panic attacks related to the fear of vomiting,1
specific phobia of vomiting,1
norovirus and treatment options,1
why do you think you will be sick,1
those antibiotics for nausea,1
will the withdrawal make me sick,1
they dry heave a lot,1
acid coming up and sticking in my throat,1
severe belly bug when i was young,1
violently ill constantly,1
kids getting sick in class,1
before my stomach bug last year,1

my sister got carsick everytime we went anywhere,1
him getting violently ill all the time,1
my dad was super sick when i was young,1
whenever he would vomit,1
i just always felt sick and terrified of being sick,1
i never had this fear until i was thrown up on,1
some guy who had a stomach bug,1
even the mention of being nausea makes me nervous,1
watched my mom violently projectile vomit,1
she projectile vomited all over my back patio,1
walk anywhere that i knew had vomit on it,1
they vomited as we spun,1
ended up getting sick everywhere,1
had a severe case of food poisoning from kfc,1
can not stand other people being ill,1
an alcoholic mother who would vomit all the time,1
she would puke and then freak out,1
the nausea that comes along with it,1
sick scenes in movies,1
coughing and wretching,1
so nauseous right now,1
constant pain or nausea,1
makes you feel more nauseous,1
