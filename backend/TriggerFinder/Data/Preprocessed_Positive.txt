no one likes to see someone vomit
if you vomit you will not be scared anymore
it was mostly from stomach bugs when i was a kid
i think i have not puked since i was  or 
i used to catch stomach bugs very often
vomit free since 
there was a stomach bug going about
and the fact that kids end up getting sick all the time
how did you deal with him being sick
i did not deal too well with stomach bugs
i would rather deal with morning sickness though
wondering when he will wake up sick in the night or if his classmates are sick
public school has not been an issue with sickness
he is a little older and vomiting is not a main concern
but i still did not get sick at all
i have a  year old boy and i am pregnant with another boy
but his dad is not bothered by sickness
ill  times a day or more
i have  kids and freak out if someone is sick
my daughter gets tonsillitis a lot and vomits with it but you get used to it
i was never sick never even had morning sickness
i am dreading her first stomach bug
i am confident that with proper hygiene i will not get the bug from her
yes it is terrible when my kids get sick but i have always made it through
i had severe morning sickness with my youngest but i never threw up from it
i was scared my whole pregnancy that i would have morning sickness
even if i had experienced lots of sickness he would be worth it
i am terrified of pregnancy because if i vomit i will relapse
i was terrified because i just knew i would be ill
i got lucky though because i did not get sick my whole pregnancy
i was sick with all pregnancies
i would love a child but do not think i could cope with the nausea
i am afraid i will puke
i have a virus and i have been vomiting everyday and its been rough
severe vomiting and fever
i can not eat much without throwing it back up
it will stop the vomiting
i am so hungry though due to vomiting
right now as we speak i feel like i will puke again
panic is crap but at least you did not vomit
had a massive panic attack the other because i thought i was going to puke
i have been having a lot of health anxiety
it reminds me to focus on my goals instead of dwelling on my health anxiety
one night when i was feeling super sick and felt like nothing was going right
sos smoked so much weed and now i feel super ill
the burps coming up my esophagus and it makes me ill
i heard it makes you very nauseous
i am getting chills feeling run down nauseous etc
my stomach is growling like mad
just that horrible nausea feeling all day
nothing makes me panic quite like morning nausea
it is progressed to watery diarrhea and severe vertigo
can being dehydrated cause nausea
after a night of feeling bad i get home and now cuddling a bucket
so far i have collapsed had my head in a bucket twice
why are you so sick all the time
were you sick
did you vomit
are you still puking
i am not throwing up now just a bit queasy
had stomach cramps and now have diarrhea and i feel nauseous
i am so worried i have got a bug
it is the anxiety most probably causing the sick feeling
overcome this anxiety and sick feeling
i woke up feeling nauseous
no acidic nausea in my throat but my stomach still feels icky
anyone get really dizzy and nauseous often
my chronic nausea is from anxiety regarding this phobia
hunger always makes my nausea worse
i have had food poisoning several times
the food you ate with your family making you ill
anxiety is the number one cause of any and all of my nausea
my nausea is an actual illness
i started feeling bad earlier
i did not know if it was indigestion from eating
feeling so sick to my stomach
i am so anxious because my stomach has been hurting all day and gurgling
and i am super nauseous right now
i am scared it is a bug
my stomach keeps gurgling and i feel nauseous like my throat is tight
it sounds like you might have some reflux
i have a slight headache intense nausea and i feel like i am about to gag
i am not feeling good i think it is gonna happen
every morning i feel nauseous and last week it happened
i am scared thinking it will happen again because i am really nauseous again
most of the times i start to feel nauseous after breakfast
my stomach is all quesy and i am so scared it is a bug
they have not been sick
i do not think it is that making me feel sick
i had a stomach bug back in december and i am scared i will catch another one
to catch one you have to ingest the virus particles
there are many different strains of stomach bugs
i got terrible nausea and dizziness
i am absolutely terrified and am afraid i will puke
is used to prevent vomiting
i thought every morning i would wake up sick
i always get nausea and either diarrhea
anyone get nauseous after eating like throat gets the throw up sensation
gives me horrible acid reflux
acting like they were gagging themselves
how long has it been since you threw up last
the experience of throwing up in front of people
i am not so much afraid of myself throwing up only other people
and throw up right at the finish line
for me to sit there with somebody throwing up i would have to be forced
the fear and anxiety i get from somebody even coughing super hard or gagging
how much money it would take for you to willingly throw up once
i am just terrified that i might throw up in front of people
i wanna start understanding throwing up is normal
i have not thrown up since i was really suffering with my phobia
i am not so much afraid to be sick myself but afraid of others getting sick
i can not handle being in the same home with anyone who is getting sick
my husband leaves the house if he feels sick
someone outside of the people in my home be sick
i feel really bad right now
i had diarrhea twice my stomach is making noises
how many times have you thrown up and why
threw up on  different occasions
 were stomach bugs
and one was travel sickness
used to throw up as a kid like everyone else
only thrown up  times all from alcohol
you have never had a stomach bug
i refused to puke
i have had a few stomach bugs where i did not vomit
i am too scared to get drunk in case i vomit
have a terrible hangover that makes me sick
getting drunk was standard
takes about a whole bottle to make me throw up
throwing up feels so normal and natural
i have witnessed my girlfriend throw up in front of me
i was really sick for ages
i was just throwing up i ended up in hospital
never had stomach bug
throw up when i am on my period
i have thrown up many times from alcohol
it is other people being sick that i am scared of
i kinda need to be able to cope with others being sick
people throw up all the time
i am fine with animals but can not even do baby spit up
if anyone even said they were feeling sick near me
my sister was in the er once and throwing up
boys who are throwing up from a bleed
if only i can do the same for myself vomiting
when she said she felt sick and gave her a bowl
i could not even cope with spit up
exposure did not work for myself getting sick
if my boyfriend is throwing up i can deal
i can not cope with my boyfriend throwing up
because of them always getting sick
i can be around anyone throwing up
i can not watch people throwing up
the actual vomit itself makes me feel funny
if my friends are sick when i am drunk
it does make me gag if i see it
i threw up about  or  times from being sick
i had not been sick at all until i caught a bug again and threw up
the last  times i had the stomach bug i did not throw up
used to throw up after every feed as a baby
i will still throw up after meals i have only puked twice
i only threw up twice when i was a kid
never a stomach bug
i do not know if i have ever had a stomach bug
i have felt sick before but i do anything to avoid vomiting
i have not thrown up since i was 
i threw up only due to having a bad gastritis episode
managed to not throw up again
and food poisoning
what was the food poisoning from
have not gotten sick since then
i am  and have never thrown up
i projectile vomited once as a baby
gastritis is the worst because all i do is dry heave
all i do is dry heave and it is the worst

it stops the nausea
salmonella at age

i wanna vomit all over
is throwing up in his grave
he is complaining of bad stomach cramps
he is been vomiting and having diarrhea all night
just gone to toilet again to vomit
does it sound like food poisoning or a stomach bug
it sounds like food poisoning
you can not catch food poisoning
i know it is more than likely food poisoning
he is saying his stomach is so sore
i am sure he just has food poisoning
some bacteria that causes food poisoning is not contagious
you can catch food poisoning of certain kinds
definitely food poisoning
food poisoning is horrible is not it
i do not think food poisoning can hit in a half hour
food poisoning does not usually set in the fast
might not be food poisoning since it is so sudden
within  minutes she was really ill
i had bad food poisoning after a dodgy sausage roll
if it is food poisoning it has most likely
and some food poisoning is contagious
